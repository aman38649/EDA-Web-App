## Introduction

Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach for Data Analysis that employs a variety of techniques to-Gain intuition about the data. Conduct sanity checks. (To be sure that insights we are drawing are actually from the right dataset).

## Existing Work And Limitations

  - Except For R And Python, All Major Apps are Paid. So They Feasible For Initial learning Basis.

  - R Programming And Python Requires the user To Learn about Libraries Before performing any tasks, so they require prior knowledge to these programmes.

  - Using App Would Make The Data Entry A Easy Job, than using existing program based softwares.
  
## Proposed Work And Methadology

  - Proposed solution is That We Are Using EDA web app. An web application  in Python using Pandas Profiling and Streamlit. With this app you will be able to upload a    CSV data to the app and it will automatically generate an exploratory data analysis (EDA) report.
  - We Would Be Doing The Following Tasks :
    1. Data review
    2. Data visualization
    3. Correlation analysis
    
## Hardware Requirements

  - Hosting server or 
  - Old pc with linux operating system or Windows.
  
## Software Requirements

  - Python
  - Pandas
  - streamlit
  - numpy
  - pands-profiling

## Pandas Profiling

Pandas profiling is an open source Python module with which we can quickly do an exploratory data analysis with just a few lines of code. Besides, if this is not enough to convince us to use this tool, it also generates interactive reports in web format that can be presented to any person, even if they don’t know programming.

## Streamlit
  - With the launch of Streamlit, developing a dashboard for your machine learning solution has been made incredibly easy.
  - Streamlit is an open source app framework specifically designed for ML engineers working with Python. It allows you to create a stunning looking application with only a few lines of code.
  - Streamlit lets you turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes, not weeks. It's all Python, open-source, and free! And once you've created an app you can use our free sharing platform to deploy, manage, and share your app with the world.
  - Streamlit makes it incredibly easy to build interactive app
